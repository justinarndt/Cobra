# benchmarks/gaudi/resnet50_inference.py
#
# Benchmarks the end-to-end inference latency of a ResNet-50 model
# on an Intel Gaudi accelerator. This serves as a complex, real-world
# test of the entire Gaudi backend, from Python AST down to the dynamic
# compilation and execution of a SynapseAI graph. The primary goal is
# to validate that the performance of the JIT-compiled model is on par
# with the native, highly optimized PyTorch-Habana implementation.

# A real implementation would require a helper library to define
# the layers of a neural network in a way the JIT can understand.

# ... Benchmark runner code ...
# 1. Load a sample input image.
# 2. Convert it to a cobra.array.
# 3. Perform warm-up runs of resnet50_inference.
# 4. Time the execution over many iterations to get a stable latency measurement.
# 5. Compare this latency to a baseline measurement taken from the
#    official PyTorch-Habana implementation running the same model.
