# benchmarks/gpu/black_scholes.py
#
# Benchmarks the performance of the Black-Scholes option pricing
# formula. This is a classic algorithm used in computational finance
# and serves as an excellent real-world test case for our JIT compiler.
# The benchmark will compare the performance of a pure Python function
# decorated with @cobra.jit against a baseline NumPy implementation on the CPU
# and a hand-written, pre-compiled native SYCL C++ version to measure
# how close our JIT gets to "bare-metal" performance.

    # operations. All of these will be fused by the JIT into a single kernel.

# 1. Generate large arrays of random input data.
# 2. Convert to cobra.array objects.
# 3. Time the execution of black_scholes_cobra.
# 4. Time the execution of black_scholes_numpy.
# 5. Load and time the native C++ version.
# 6. Print a comparison of the results.
