# Implements a simple n-body simulation benchmark. This workload is more
# complex than simple element-wise kernels as it involves non-sequential
# memory access patterns and more complex arithmetic. It's a good test of
# the JIT compiler's ability to handle more general-purpose scientific
# computing tasks.
