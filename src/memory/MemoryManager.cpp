#include "memory/MemoryManager.h"

// The implementation for the MemoryManager class is now defined inline
// within the 'MemoryManager.h' header file. This is a common pattern for
// modern C++ libraries that are heavily reliant on templates and header-only
// APIs, such as SYCL.

// This source file is intentionally kept minimal. Its primary purpose is to
// provide a compilation unit for the 'cobra_runtime' library target in our
// CMake build system. Any non-inline static member definitions or other
// source-specific code would be placed here.

namespace cobra {
    // Currently, no additional definitions are needed.
}
